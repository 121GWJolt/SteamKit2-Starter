# SteamKit2-Starter
A (VERY) basic SteamKit2 bot meant as a template for new bots created with SteamKit2.

I decided one day that I'd just make this, honestly.
The purpose of this whole thing is to try and give people a basis for their own bot and let them build up from it.  It's supposed to be somewhat basic, so any advancements beyond a seperate point will go in a different repo if these differences are to be made.
This bot runs with CLI, uses SteamKit2 as a basis, has commands you can run from the console at basically any time, VERY basic local storage password encryption (not gonna stop anyone determined to crack it, but it's better than plaintext), and support for handling SteamGuard (both email and phone-based).  Requires that you find your SteamID and assign it to the bot (explained in the source code).  Simple to start with, comments will be added to some extent over time to explain things.
Happy botting!
